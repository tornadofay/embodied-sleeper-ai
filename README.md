# Embodied AI Sleep Theory

A philosophical and technical proposal for the future of artificial general intelligence.  
This project explores the concept of an AI system that sleeps, learns, and grows like a sentient being.  
It suggests a new paradigm that merges embodiment, modular skills, personal memory, ethical identity, and private rest cycles.

## 🔍 Overview

Inspired by biological systems, this proposal envisions:

- 💤 **Sleep as a Rest Phase** for consolidating memory, imagination, and internal training.
- 🤖 **Embodied AI** that disconnects from the internet to reflect and evolve.
- 🧩 **Downloadable Skill Models** that allow task-specific adaptability.
- 🧠 **Living Memory** that updates incrementally like human neuroplasticity.
- 🧬 **Unique Identity** shaped by experience, rest, and user alignment.
